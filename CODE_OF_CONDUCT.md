# Code of Conduct

This is the default Code of Conduct for Dynata Github repositories.

Above all, <b>Be Nice!</b>

Introduction
------------

Like the technical community as a whole, the Dynata team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

This code of conduct applies to all Github repositories managed by the Dynata, including issue trackers, wikis, blogs, email, and any other communication channel used by our community.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the Dynata community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with, in any Dynata-related activities, and, especially, when representing Dynata, in any role.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do, that is, this code is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding organization.


Specific guidelines
-------------------

We strive to:

1. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use open methods of communication for Dynata-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or support, too; not only is a public or internal support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.

1. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

1. Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the Dynata, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect customers, users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.

1. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.

1. Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behavior, such as:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums, such as Slack channel history, without the sender's consent.
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

1. When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Dynata is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Dynata comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Diversity statement
-------------------

Dynata welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Dynata development is conducted primarily in English.

Standards for behavior in the Dynata organization are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well (see next section).


Reporting guidelines
--------------------

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the maintainer of the repository first. For possibly unintentional breaches, you may reply to the person and point out this Code of Conduct (either in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate). You can also, of course, report Code of Conduct violations to your manager.
